# Shaun the Sheep
Shaun, an unusually bright and clever sheep, lives with his flock at Mossy Bottom Farm (the name being revealed in the fourth season), a traditional small northern English farm. 
In each episode, their latest attempt to add excitement to their dull mundane life as livestock somehow snowballs into a fantastic sitcom-style escapade, most often with the help of their fascination with human doings and devices. 

This usually brings them into conflict—and often into partnership—with the farm sheepdog Bitzer, while they all are simultaneously trying to avoid discovery by the Farmer.
